# Card Blackjack Game

Thank you for viewing my JS practice and now... Welcome to the  Card Blackjack Game!

In this game, your objective is to beat the computer by getting 21 points or getting as close as possible to this number without going over. This game will be created using JavaScript, and you'll face a challenging opponent: the computer.

## Game Instructions

### Game Start:
At the beginning, both you and the computer will receive two cards each. Both player's cards will be visible, but only one of the computer's cards will be exposed.

### Card Values:
Numeric cards (2 to 10) have the value they indicate, face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each, and the Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what benefits the player.

### Player's Turn:
You have the option to "hit" for additional cards to increase your score or "stand" with the cards you have. If the sum of your cards exceeds 21, you automatically lose.

### Computer's Turn:
Once you decide to stand, the computer reveals its second card and makes decisions based on a predefined strategy. The computer will try to beat your score without going over 21.

### Determining the Winner:
If you get exactly 21 points with your two initial cards (an Ace and a face card or a 10), you automatically win. If the computer and you have less than 21 points, the one with the highest score wins. If both have the same score, it's considered a tie.
